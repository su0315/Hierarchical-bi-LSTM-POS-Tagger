# Hierarchical-bi-LSTM-POS-Tagger

In this group project, we try to replicate the result of the paper "Multilingual Part-of-Speech Tagging with
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Models and Auxiliary Loss" by Barbara etal. (2016). 

To run main.ipynb, download [data](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-1548) and [polyglot](https://github.com/bplank/bilstm-aux). 

The project is still ongoing, we'll add  requirements file and trained models in the near future.
